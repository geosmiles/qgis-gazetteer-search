I have provided two examples of files which will create web services. One searches the LLPG and the other the LSG. Just copy and edit these files for each web service you want to create.

Provided you have suitable tables in your PostGIS database with UPRN and ADDRESS fields, a record in the gazetteers/config.ini file and a file in the cgi-bin the search will work.
